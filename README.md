# AES_implement

This repository contains an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The AES algorithm is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong security for data confidentiality.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KienHoSD/AES_implement.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AES_implement`
3. Build the project using the provided Makefile: `make`
4. Run the AES encryption/decryption program: `./aes`

## Makefile

The Makefile included in this repository provides an easy way to build the project. It contains the following targets:

- `all` (default): Builds the AES program.
- `clean`: Removes the compiled binaries and object files.
- `run`: Runs the AES program.

You can use these targets by running `make <target>` in the project directory.
